# portfoliopage

This is the initial portfolio page that we will create.
The only file that I have attached is a not as yet completed Run-Buddy lesson page.
The other 4 images are placeholders for links to future projects. The page was completed with flexbox and Css grid tecniques.
Images used were free use images.
The about me information is accurate and real. The links are accurate and functional.
