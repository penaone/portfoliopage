    <article id="Bio">
        <p>I am new to the developer field. I have been involved in a number of different pursuits in my life,
            but have always enjoyed technology. I have a bachelor's degree in accounting and worked a number of years
            in that field. I sold investments and life insurance for a few years after that. I found a passion in
            teaching several years ago and have a Masters Degree in Education. All of these fields require 
            problem solving. This is also required in coding. In a few years I will retire from Teaching and fully pursue
            a career as a Developer.
